* Edit the help file skeletons in 'man', possibly combining help files for multiple
  functions.
* Edit the exports in 'NAMESPACE', and add necessary imports.
* Put any C/C++/Fortran code in 'src'.
* If you have compiled code, add a useDynLib() directive to 'NAMESPACE'.
* Run R CMD build to build the package tarball.
* Run R CMD check to check the package tarball.

Read "Writing R Extensions" for more information.


Stan specific notes:

* Be sure to add useDynLib(mypackage, .registration = TRUE) to the NAMESPACE file.
* Be sure to import all of Rcpp and methods in the NAMESPACE file.
* You can put into inst/chunks/common_functions.stan any function that is needed by any .stan file, 
in which case any .stan file can have #include 'common_functions.stan' in its functions block.
* The precompiled stanmodel objects will appear in a named list called 'stanmodels'.
* The 'cleanup' and 'cleanup.win' scripts in the root of the directory must be made executable.
